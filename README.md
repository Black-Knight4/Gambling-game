# Gambling-game
A simple terminal-based slot machine game written in Python. The player starts with a balance of $100 and places bets each round. Three random symbols are generated per spin, and winnings are calculated if all three symbols match. Each symbol has a different payout multiplier, while losing spins subtract the bet from the balance.
